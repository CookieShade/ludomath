# Ludomath
A Rust library containing various math & number functions,
primarily suited for 2D graphics & game programming.
As such, it has an emphasis on speed, although admittedly
doesn't currently do any explicit SIMD optimizations.

Includes functions, constants and traits for 2D vector math
& transformations with matrices, cheap random number generation,
as well as a few basic numeric functions.
